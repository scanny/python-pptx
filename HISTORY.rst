+++++++++++++++++++

- fix: #912 Pillow<=9.5 constraint entails security vulnerability

0.6.19 (2021-05-17)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Add shapes.add_ole_object(), allowing arbitrary Excel or other binary file to be
  embedded as a shape on a slide. The OLE object is represented as an icon.


0.6.18 (2019-05-02)
+++++++++++++++++++

- .text property getters encode line-break as a vertical-tab (VT, '\v', ASCII 11/x0B).
  This is consistent with PowerPoint's copy/paste behavior and allows like-breaks (soft
  carriage-return) to be distinguished from paragraph boundary. Previously, a line-break
  was encoded as a newline ('\n') and was not distinguishable from a paragraph boundary.

  .text properties include Shape.text, _Cell.text, TextFrame.text, _Paragraph.text and
  _Run.text.

- .text property setters accept vertical-tab character and place a line-break element in
  that location. All other control characters other than horizontal-tab ('\t') and
  newline ('\n') in range \x00-\x1F are accepted and escaped with plain-text like
  "_x001B" for ESC (ASCII 27).

  Previously a control character other than tab or newline in an assigned string would
  trigger an exception related to invalid XML character.

**BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:**

Some changes were made to the boilerplate XML used to create new charts. This
was done to more closely adhere to the settings PowerPoint uses when creating
a chart using the UI. This may result in some appearance changes in charts
after upgrading. In particular:

* Chart.has_legend now defaults to True for Line charts.
* Plot.vary_by_categories now defaults to False for Line charts.

0.5.0 (2014-09-13)
++++++++++++++++++

- Add support for creating and manipulating bar, column, line, and pie charts
- Major refactoring of XML layer (oxml)
- Rationalized graphical object shape access
  **Note backward incompatibilities below**

**BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:**

A table is no longer treated as a shape. Rather it is a graphical object
contained in a GraphicFrame shape, as are Chart and SmartArt objects.

Example::

    table = shapes.add_table(...)

    # becomes

    graphic_frame = shapes.add_table(...)
    table = graphic_frame.table

    # or

    table = shapes.add_table(...).table

As the enclosing shape, the id, name, shape type, position, and size are
attributes of the enclosing GraphicFrame object.

The contents of a GraphicFrame shape can be identified using three available
properties on a shape: has_table, has_chart, and has_smart_art. The enclosed
graphical object is obtained using the properties GraphicFrame.table and
GraphicFrame.chart. SmartArt is not yet supported. Accessing one of these
properties on a GraphicFrame not containing the corresponding object raises
an exception.
