Use cases
=========

The use case that drove me to begin work on this library has been to automate
the building of slides that are tedious to compose by hand. As an example,
consider the task of composing a slide with an array of 10 headshot images of
folks in a particular department, with the person's name and title next to
their picture. After doing this a dozen times and struggling to get all the
alignment and sizes to the point where my attention to detail is satisfied,
well, my coding fingers got quite itchy.

However I believe a broader application will be server-side document
generation on non-Windows server platforms, Linux primarily I expect. In my
organization, I have found an apparently insatiable demand for PowerPoint
documents as a means of communication. Once one rises beyond the level of
project manager it seems the willingness to interpret text longer than a
bullet point atrophies quite rapidly and PowerPoint becomes an everyday
medium. I've imagined it might be pretty cool to be able to generate a
"presentation-ready" deck for a salesperson that includes a particular subset
of the product catalog they could generate with a few clicks to use in a sales
presentation, for example. As you come up with applications I'd love to hear
about them.
